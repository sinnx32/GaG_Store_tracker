### [CHANGELOGS](https://github.com/Just3itx/Grow-A-Garden-API/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

Welcome to the **Grow a Garden API**. This open-source API provides a straightforward way to access in-game gardening data—including stock levels, weather conditions, and item information—without the need to host or maintain bots yourself.

It uses the **Vulcan API** to gather all relevant information in real-time, eliminating the need for users to run and manage bots that stay AFK in the game. The API also supports real-time restock updates, ensuring you always have the most current data.

features include:
- Access to in-game gardening stock data using the Vulcan API.
- Retrieval of current weather conditions relevant to the game.
- Detailed item information available through the API.
- Real-time restock notifications as they occur.
- Fully open-source and available for community use and contribution.
